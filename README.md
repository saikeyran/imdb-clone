# IMDB_CloneApp



## Problem statement
Create a mini IMDB clone app. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for Javascript (you can use any css framework like Bootstrap).
## Features

1.Home Page

Search any movie from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
Each search result of the movie should have a favourite button, clicking on which the movie should be added to “My favourite movies” (a list).
On clicking any particular search result (any movie), open a new page with more information about that movie (movie page)

2.Movie Page

Should show information about the movie like its name, photo, plot, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).

3.My favourite movies Page

Display a list of all the favourite movies.
Make this list persistent (should have the same number of movies before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).
Remove from favourites button: Each movie should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that movie from the list.


## Languages Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap 
## What I learned

This project likely involves working with asynchronous operations, handling API requests, and implementing core features of a movie database application. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of independent problem-solving and the integration of external data sources into a web application.
## Deployment

To deploy this project run index.html file on your browser.
